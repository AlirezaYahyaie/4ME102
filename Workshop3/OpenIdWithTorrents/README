This simple php implementation lets you log in with a Google OpenId to upload files. Torrents are generated from these files which can then be used for distribution of these files.

This simple prototype requires a couple of things to work.

* Two directories in the same folder as index.php called "torrents" and "files" which needs to be writable for the user of the webserver.
* Inserting the tables from Tables.sql into a db server.

This example is also used as an example to track down security issues in PHP projects, can you find catch them all? :)
